## About the Collection

The Muskuy Yachay (“Dream Knowledge”) Archive is a collection of photographs, videos, and texts that relate to the storytelling tradition about muskuy-- dream and other visionary experiences-- among Kichwa-speaking Runa of the tropical lowlands of Ecuador. Muskuy is a state of enhanced perception during which Runa perceive more of the actions and intentions of other persons, allowing them to foresee future events and understand causal relationship of current predicaments. Commonplace muskuy experiences are ones that determine cause and treatment of illness, and that forecast major life events. The stories of muskuy experience are circulated orally in the compendium of community ancestral knowledge.

The original documents of this collection were created between 2012-2017 in the Napo and Pastaza provinces of Ecuador as part of Lisa (Warren) Carney’s doctoral dissertation research. Carney learned from and collaborated with several Runa women and men from the Napo and Pastaza provinces of Ecuador, principally: Carmen Andi, Pedro Andi, Elodia Cadena, Luisa Cadena, Bélgica Dagua, David Dagua, Delicia Dagua, Elodia Dagua, Richar Emunda, Gerardo Gualinga, and Inés Shiguango. Interviews were conducted in several settings, mainly on the property of the Andes-Amazon Field School at Iyarina Lodge in Venecia del Norte, Ecuador, or at the speakers’ homes. In several audiovisual recordings, Professor Tod D. Swanson of Arizona State University and director of the Andes-Amazon Field school was a facilitator of storytelling events, as a fluent speaker of Kichwa and Carney’s language instructor. North American undergraduate and graduate students are occasionally present for storytelling events, as are several leading scholars in Kichwa area studies. Kichwa-language narratives were transcribed and translated into Spanish by Carney. The Spanish language translations would be corrected by Inés and Rosa Shiguango, then used as reference for translations from Kichwa into English, by Carney. American scholars Tod Swanson, Regina Harrison, and Janis Nuckolls provided support for particularly challenging passages. 

The first version of this collection is targeted for a user group of English-speaker that are scholars or members of the general public. Future phases of this collection will involve complete translation into Spanish, the primary language spoken by most Runa today, so that the community members have full access to the collection as is their right and is the responsibility of the researcher. 

Future versions of this collection will also be open for contributions by the public. Contact Lisa W. Carney (lisawcarney@gmail.com) with suggestions, questions, and comments.
